# MatchFlix
Proof of concept for a Tinder-like app to find movies that both you and your partner (or friend, or family member or whatever)  want to watch. You swipe movies left or right and when you both swipe right on the same movie you have a match and you can stream it via Netflix or Prime Video or other platforms.
